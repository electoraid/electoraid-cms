# Electoraid Data Management System

A Django rig for managing election data. The Electoraid Data Management System provides foundational data tools for tracking local government and elections. 

The Electoraid Data Management System is meant to be run in concert with the Electoraid API. The realtime API connects data from the management system with multiple public datasets, specialized APIs such as AP election results, and manual sources like Google Sheets.
